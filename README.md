- ## Tasks 
    1. Create docker images and containers
    2. Push Docker Images to the docker hub registry 
    3. Run Microservices as containers and use custom networking to connect to microservices 
    4. Docker compose concepts 


## Jenkins
- Create Pipeline to Build and Push Docker Image for a Microservice
- ## Tasks

    4. Run Unit Tests and Integration Tests in Jenkins Pipelines
    5. Build and Push Docker Image in Jenkins Pipelines

## Kubernetes 
- Build and Deploy scalable and reliable microservices with Kubernetes (Deployed locally using Minikube)
- ## Tasks
    1. Setup and test locally via Minikube and Minikube dashboard
    2. Run Kubernetes helloworld application in minikube environment 
    3. Create and run simple single yaml file for deployment and service in minikube
    4. Scale helloworld application by creating replica sets
    5. Add, view, delete and search for labels during build time and for running pods
    6. Upgrade a deployment from one version to another and rollback to first version
    7. Declare and call a configmap from deployment
    8. Declare and add a secret to a deployment
    9. Run jobs, cron jobs, daemonsets, stateful sets
    10. Deploy a sample application to kubernetes 
    11. Create a configmap and secrets that can be referenced by the application via env variables and volume mounted file 
    12. Understand what Helm is and run a helm chart for the kubernetes application 
    13. Ingress Controllers: Understand what ingress/envoy are and how it can be implemented with Contour and envoy 
    14. Deploy Prometheus and view K8s stats, node info and application metrics
    15. Start up EFK (Elastic-Fluentd-Kibana) stack in minikube -> run application and analyze logs in Kibana
